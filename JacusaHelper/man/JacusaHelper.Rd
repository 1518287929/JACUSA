\title{JacusaHelper: A package for post-processing JACUSA result files.}
\description{
The JacusaHelper package provides three categories of important functions:
InputOutput, AddInfo, and Filter.
}
\details{
When calling RDDs where the RNA-Seq sample has been generated with stranded sequencing library, base change(s) can be directly inferred and if necessary base calls can be inverted.
Per default DNA need to be provided as sample 1 and cDNA as sample 2!
Warning: Some function do not support replicates or are exclusively applicable on RDD or RRD result files!
use l <- Read(l) to read the data
and then sample <- Samples(l, 1) to extract the sample specific data
then continue with ToMatrix(sample)
}
\section{InputOutput functions}{

The functions Read, and Write facilitate input and output operations on JACUSA output files.
}

\section{AddInfo functions}{

This functions calculate and add additional information such as read depth or base changes. 
This includes functions convert base counts that are encoded as character vectors to base count matrices.
See: 
* AddCoverageInfo
* AddBaseChangeInfo
* AddEditingFreqInfo
}

\section{Filter functions}{

This function set enables processing of JACUSA output files such as filtering by read coverage or enforcing a minimal number of variant base calls per sample.
See:
* FilterByStat
* FilterResult
* FilterByMinVariant
}
