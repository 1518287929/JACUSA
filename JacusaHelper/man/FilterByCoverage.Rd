\title{Filters sites by read coverage.}
\usage{
FilterByCoverage(data, fields, cov)
}
\arguments{
\item{fields}{Character vector indicates if filtering should be carried out on total read coverage of both samples fields = c("cov1", "cov2") or on each replicate of sample 2: fields = c("covs2"). Possible values are: "cov1", "cov2", "covs1", or "covs2".}

\item{cov}{Vector or numeric value of the minimal read coverage.}

\item{l}{List object created by \code{Read()}.}
}
\value{
Returns List of sites filtered by minimal read coverage according to fields and cov.
}
\description{
\code{FilterByCoverage} filters sites by customizable read coverage restrictions.
}
\examples{
## Read JACUSA result file JACUSA.out
data <- Read(data)
## Keep sites that have a total read depth of at least 10 reads in sample 1 and each of sample 2 replicates has a minimal read coverage of 5 reads. 
data <- FilterByCoverage(data, fields = c("cov1", "covs2"), cov = c(10, 5))
