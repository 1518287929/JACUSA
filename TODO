Questions:
1. how to represent used bases?
2. use char, int or byte to represent bases?


1.
Design:
bases: a c g t (n)
compl: t g c a (n)

Example:
Goal: A G stranded
translates to:
bases: 0 , 3
Goal: A G unstranded
translates to: 0 1 2 3

implement
bases as array
use array of ints to reference to bases
temp: 0,1 use -> A and C

2.
Samtools uses byte to represent bases
decode byte when writing to file
TODO
howto map from byte to int?

Filter
======

1. choose filters before program starts
2. save filter factories in parameters
	fix order, provided!
3. ParallelBuilderFilterCache -> process gices caches that is saved

some filters don't have CacheFilters - ignore

Stranded and Unstranded
